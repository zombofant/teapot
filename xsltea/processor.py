Templates are processed using :class:`TemplateProcessor` instances. These
interpret the template contents and can be used to implement arbitrary
extensions.

.. autoclass:: TemplateProcessor
   :members:

"""

import abc
import functools

@functools.total_ordering
class ProcessorMeta(type):
    """
    This metaclass is used to keep the ordering and dependency attributes of the
    processor classes in sync.

    Classes with this metaclass (e.g. all classes inheriting from
    :class:`TemplateProcessor`) can use the following attributes:

    .. attribute:: REQUIRES

       This can be assigned an iterable of processor classes which are required
       by the processor. These processors will also be loaded by the
       :class:`xsltea.Engine` upon loading this processor.

    .. attribute:: AFTER

       This can be assigned an iterable of processor classes after which the
       current processor wants to be loaded.

    .. attribute:: BEFORE

       This can be assigned an iterable of processor classes before which the
       current processor wants to be loaded.

    .. note::
       All attributes must be created at class construction time. Later
       alterations are not allowed and can lead to strange behaviour including
       infinite loops.

    All attributes are available after class construction, even if not specified
    in the original class. The :attr:`AFTER` and :attr:`BEFORE` attributes are
    kept in sync with other definitions. That is, if you have a processor class
    `A` and another processor class `B` which specifies `A` in its `AFTER`
    attribute, `B` will show up in the `BEFORE` attribute of `A` afterwards.

    Note that mentioning a processor in :attr:`AFTER` will not make it being
    loaded by the :class:`Engine` automatically. The Before-After relation is
    orthogonal to the Requires-relation.

    The relationship established by :attr:`BEFORE` and :attr:`AFTER` is
    transitive.
