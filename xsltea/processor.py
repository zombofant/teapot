``xsltea.processor`` â€“ Template processor plugins base
######################################################

Templates are processed using :class:`TemplateProcessor` instances. These
interpret the template contents and can be used to implement arbitrary
extensions.

.. autoclass:: TemplateProcessor
   :members:

class TemplateProcessor:
    """
    This is the base class for template processors.

    Processor instances must have two attributes:

    .. attribute:: attrhooks

       A dictionary containing entries of the structure
       ``(elemns, elemname, xmlns, name): [attribute_hook]``. The ``xmlns`` must
       be a string refering to an XML namespace (or :data:`None`, to match on
       namespaceless attributes). `name` must be a string refering to the
       attributes local name or :data:`None` to match all attributes in the
       namespace.

       *elemns* and *elemname* are the namespace and the local name of the
       element at which the attribute appears. Putting these two in front of the
       tuple is entirely optional: they can be set to :data:`None` or omitted
       (so that the key is a 2-tuple instead of a 4-tuple). It is also valid to
       set only *elemname* to :data:`None`, to match all elements in a given
       namespace.

       The signature and semantics of the ``attribute_hook`` functions are as
       follows:

       .. function:: attribute_hook(template, element, key, value, context) ->
                     (precode, elemcode, keycode, valuecode, postcode)

          The *template* is the template which is calling the hook. This is
          useful to make use of the helper functions provided by the
          :class:`Template` class.

          *element* is the :class:`lxml.etree._Element` instance to which the
          attribute having the name *key* (including the namespace in the usual
          etree notation) belongs. To save lookups, the *value* of the attribute
          is also included.

          *context* is a :class:`xsltea.template.Context` object which provides
          the processing context, including any hooks.

          The return value is a tuple of several items:

          * *precode*: A list of AST statement objects (such as
            :class:`ast.Expr` and :class:`ast.Assign`) which are prepended to
            the code of the function describing the element (and all of its
            siblings).
          * *elemcode*: A list of AST statement objects, which are inserted
            after the element construction. Within these, the name `elem` refers
            to the element currently being dealt with. It is thus possible to
            include calls to `elem.set(key, value)` in that code.
          * *keycode* and *valuecode*: If no special handling is required, the
            key and value expressions for the attribute, as you would pass them
            to `elem.set()` can be passed here directly. If you set the
            attribute manually in *elemcode*, set this to :data:`None`. Setting
            the attribute using *keycode* and *valuecode* might be faster.
          * *postcode*: This code is appended to the end of the function
            describing the element (and all of its siblings.

          .. note::

             Attributes on ``tea:if`` and ``tea:case`` elements have special
             semantics. The *keycode* is ignored and the *valuecode* must not be
             :data:`None`. A warning is emitted if *keycode* is not
             :data:`None`.

             The code provided in *valuecode* is used as branching condition in
             the respective element. If multiple conditions are present, they
             will be concatenated with an ``and`` operator, but the order of
             execution is unspecified (thus, having side effects in the
             conditions invokes kind of undefined behaviour, as short-circuiting
             may take place; this might be fixed in a future version, but due to
             the way ElementTree attribute access works, it is unclear whether
             this will be possible).

             To maintain backwards compatibility, hooks will only be called for
             ``tea:if`` and ``tea:case`` if they are explicitly specified for
             those using the 4-tuple key in the :attr:`attrhooks` dict. Other
             attributes on ``tea:if`` and ``tea:case`` raise warnings and are
             ignored.

    .. attribute:: elemhooks

       A dictionary containing entries of the structure
       ``(xmlns, name): [element_hook]``. The ``xmlns`` and ``name`` elements have
       the same semantics as for :attr:`attrhooks`, but they refer to element
       names instead of attribute names.

       The ``element_hook`` functions semantics are as follows:

       .. function:: element_hook(template, element, context, offset) ->
                     (precode, elemcode, postcode)

          The *template* is the template which is calling the hook.

          *element* is the element which is being hooked. If you want the
          element to appear in the output tree, you must construct it in the
          *elemcode* and ``yield`` it from there.

          *context* is a :class:`xsltea.template.Context` object which provides
          the processing context, including any hooks.

          *offset* is the sibling index of the element you are operating on. Use
          that as a suffix for any names, except ``elem``, you create within any
          of the code arrays.

          The return value is a tuple of several items:
          * *precode*: A list of AST statement objects (such as
            :class:`ast.Expr` and :class:`ast.Assign`) which are prepended to
            the code of the function describing the element and all of its
            siblings. Use this to define a children function, if needed (see
            :meth:`~xsltea.template.Template.compose_childrenfun` for a utility
            doing that for you).
          * *elemcode*: A list of statements which create the element in a
            variable called ``elem`` and ``yield`` it.
          * *postcode*: A list of statements which is appended to the function
            defining the element and all of its sibilings.

          You can not only yield lxml elements, but also strings. Strings will
          be inserted as text where elements would be inserted as elements as
          children to the parent element.

          It is more efficient to add ``tail``-text directly to the element, if
          you are explicitly creating an element anyways.

          A ``makeelement`` function is available in the scope all of the code
          is evaluated. It is recommended to use that function instead of
          ``etree.Element`` to create elements.

    .. attribute:: globalhooks

       A list containing callables which are called once at the start of the
       template compilation, before any other hooks are called.

       .. function global_hook(template, tree, context) -> (precode, postcode)

          The *template* is the template calling the hook. *tree* is the
          complete tree, which might be mutated by this hook.

          *context* is a :class:`xsltea.template.Context` object which provides
          the processing context.

          The return value is analogous to the previous values, except that no
          *elemcode* return value can be provided.
